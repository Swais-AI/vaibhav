"""
cleanup_seed.py — Safe Seed Data Removal
==========================================
Finds and removes ONLY the TEST_/SEED_ prefixed records that were inserted
by mock_data.py.  Real production data is never touched.

HOW IT IDENTIFIES SEEDED RECORDS
──────────────────────────────────
Every record inserted by mock_data.py carries at least one of these markers:

  full_name    LIKE 'TEST_%'   → ClassMaster, StudentMaster,
                                   ParentMaster, TeacherMaster
  email        LIKE '%_seed@%' → ParentMaster, TeacherMaster  (physical col: email_id)
  notice_title LIKE 'SEED_%'   → NoticeBoard
  ticket_number LIKE 'SEED-%'  → SupportTicket
  subject_name LIKE 'TEST_%'   → SubjectMaster
  chapter_name LIKE 'TEST_%'   → ChapterMaster
  assignment_title LIKE 'TEST_%' → AssignmentMaster
  quiz_title   LIKE 'TEST_%'   → QuizMaster

Child records (StudentSubmission, QuizResponse, TicketMessage,
ParentStudentMap) are cleaned up by matching their parent FKs
against the seeded IDs above — making the cleanup self-contained
and independent of the seed script's runtime variables.

DELETION ORDER (FK dependency chain — children before parents)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1.  TicketMessage    (FK → SupportTicket)
  2.  SupportTicket    (FK → ParentMaster, StudentMaster)
  3.  StudentSubmission(FK → AssignmentMaster, StudentMaster)
  4.  QuizResponse     (FK → QuizMaster, StudentMaster)
  5.  NoticeBoard      (FK → TeacherMaster)
  6.  AssignmentMaster (FK → ChapterMaster, TeacherMaster)
  7.  QuizMaster       (FK → ChapterMaster)
  8.  ParentStudentMap (FK → ParentMaster, StudentMaster)
  9.  ChapterMaster    (FK → SubjectMaster)
  10. SubjectMaster    (FK → ClassMaster, TeacherMaster)
  11. StudentMaster    (FK → ClassMaster)
  12. ParentMaster     (no FK dependencies)
  13. TeacherMaster    (no FK dependencies)
  14. ClassMaster      (no FK dependencies)

NOTE: TeacherParentInteractionV2 removed — sgs_teacher_parent_interaction
does NOT exist on the SGS AWS RDS production database.

USAGE
─────
  # Preview what would be deleted (safe — no writes)
  python cleanup_seed.py

  # Actually delete seeded records
  python cleanup_seed.py --confirm

WHY SCHEMA OPERATIONS ARE DANGEROUS ON RDS
───────────────────────────────────────────
  Base.metadata.drop_all()  destroys ALL tables including production data.
  Base.metadata.create_all() can silently corrupt column types or constraints
  on an existing RDS database.  Never run either against a shared database.
  This script uses only DELETE queries filtered by seed markers — 100 % safe.
